## Why Questionnaires

The questionnaires helped us understand the complexity of seniors’ progressive aging and how they deal with it.

It will be shown how improving our requirements elicitation with a better process of questioning will help developers

manage change, provide an increase in productivity and deliver more effective, usable solutions.

## Questionnaires

* Questions for the HOPE app that we built while working on our PhD work. [See website](http://appcorewill.com/questions)
* Questionnaire_before are intial questions we asked while we made a mockup of the first HOPE app
* Questionnaire_after are questions we asked while creating a second version of the HOPE app, questions validated HOPE app

## Questionnaire_before

Questionnaires are a network of linked concepts, classified into topics of inquiry to understand 

an underlying process. We find scenarios and figure out how they relate. The initial

questionnaire framework was composed of seniors’ daily living experiences and as a result, an 

initial HOPE software system was developed. 

## Questionnaire_after

The second questionnaire framework was composed of seniors’ daily living experiences, age-related health issues, and the 

initial HOPE app. HOPE was re-developed and validated by the second questionnaire along with the discovery of the medicine tracking.
